# Intermittent Empty FlatList in React Native Despite Successful Data Fetch

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList component in React Native intermittently renders empty, even though data has been successfully fetched. The issue is not consistent and appears randomly.

## Bug Description
A FlatList component is used to display data fetched from an API. Despite successful API calls and proper data handling, the FlatList remains empty on certain occasions. This behavior is irregular and doesn't follow a clear pattern.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the application (using `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`).
3. Observe the FlatList behavior. It will sometimes display the data correctly, and other times it will be empty despite successful data fetching, as evidenced by the console logs.

## Potential Causes
* **Asynchronous operations:** Improper handling of asynchronous operations might lead to the data being updated after the component has already rendered.
* **State updates:** Incorrect state updates or race conditions could prevent the FlatList from re-rendering with the updated data.
* **React Native lifecycle:** Issues related to the React Native component lifecycle might contribute to the problem.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring the data is correctly updated in the component's state and that the FlatList re-renders accordingly.  The provided solution incorporates appropriate error handling and ensures data is set after the API fetch has completed successfully.
